Text file is passed to compress function, frequency dictionary is created, text is encoded characters wise, padding is added and compression is done.

Compressed file ".bin" is then used and passed to decompress function, padding between text is removed from encoded text and text is decoded,to decompress the file and get original file.

Uploaded sample text file "sample.txt", which I have used and uploaded results of compression and of decompression
